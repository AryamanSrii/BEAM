# BEAM: BrainScan Enhancer Assistive Model

## About BEAM

BrainScan  enhancer assistive model aimed to aid doctors in detecting brain tumor or any foreign objects in brain!
The main notion of the program I built was to help as many people as it can, who are currently fighting for their lives, due to late detection of their illness. 
‚ÄúA tumor can grow in the brain and go relatively unnoticed for a great period of time,‚Äù says Dr. Dunbar. 
When symptoms do arise, they are often very generalized and most likely  be caused by other conditions. Many areas don‚Äôt advanced enough MRI or CT-SCANS and their tumor goes undetected for years and may result in the death of the patient. 
This is why I created this program. My goal is to make tumor detection more efficient and effective with the right technology. I want to provide the best possible options that will help everyone. 
This innovation of brain tumor detection has been possible due to the enhancement of technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
AI and ML are the technologies which if used properly can be used to change the world. They are nothing less than a blessing and a weapon to reform this world. With proper knowledge as well as tools, we can put these technologies to great use for better living. 
These technologies are those promising technologies that will change how we detect brain tumors. 
The idea of creating a program to detect brain tumors came from statistics that showed it‚Äôs causing more than 10000 deaths yearly and I hope that my method might create change by early detection and save many lives which are at risk.

## FAQ

#### How is Data Managed?

The Data uploaded is saved as a temprorary file in the server while you are on the site, and gets deleted instantly when you leave the side or close the app.

#### Is the Patient Data Safe?

We respect the privacy of the patient data and to keep the data save we use the python module ```stream``` which stores the upload the file as a .temp files and as mentioned is deleted instantly

#### When will it be avaible?

The Deployment of the application is in full progress. The backend which control the application is done and work on designing a easy but attractive UI has started
